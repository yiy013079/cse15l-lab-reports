My favorite lab report is lab report 3
How I did the task:
I chose to explore more functions of the grep command, and I first searched on google about how to use grep command. I found a website that contains very complete grep command guide.
Then I tried some of the commands in searching different elements in the ./written_2 file. I also tried different combination of the command to see if some of them work better.
I found that the -r command is very useful, because it can search recursively of every file in a directory, and it can be combined with many other command, such as -rn and -rl. I tried these command to see if there are differences with -rn and -n. 
Later I also had the chances to use this command when reviewing for the skill demo 1. I can directly get the name of the file that contains certain words using -rl.
